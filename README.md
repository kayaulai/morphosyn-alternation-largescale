# morphosyn-alternation-largescale

This is the GitHub repository for my current project on a large-scale approach to multifactorial analysis in morphosyntactic alternations.

The files are supposed to be run in order (1-extract.py is the first to be run, and so on.)

At the moment, I have not finished much.
